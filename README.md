# Skin Cancer Detection System

A machine learning application for detecting and classifying skin diseases using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and deep learning.

## Overview

This project implements a skin disease classification system that can identify seven different types of skin conditions:

- Actinic Keratosis (AKIEC)
- Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
- Pigmented Benign Keratosis (BKL)
- Dermatofibroma (DF)
- Melanoma (MEL)
- Nevus (NV)
- Vascular Lesion (VASC)

The system uses a combination of deep learning models and GANs to improve classification accuracy by generating synthetic training data.

## Features

- Image-based skin disease detection and classification
- Web interface for easy interaction (Flask and Streamlit options)
- Integration with Roboflow for inference
- Pre-trained models for immediate use

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for skin disease classification
- `flask_app.py`: Flask web application alternative
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the Flask web interface
- `final_model.h5`: Pre-trained classification model
- `generator.pth` & `discriminator.pth`: GAN model weights
- `images/`: Dataset images
- `generated_images/`: Synthetic images created by the GAN
- `sub_dataset/`: Additional dataset images for testing and training

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Krish-1106/skin_cancer.git
   cd skin_cancer
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Streamlit App

Run the Streamlit application:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start a web interface where you can upload skin images for classification.

### Flask App

Alternatively, run the Flask application:

```
python flask_app.py
```

Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Model Architecture

The project uses:
- A deep learning classifier for skin disease detection
- A GAN architecture to generate synthetic training data, improving model performance
- Pre-trained weights stored in `.h5` and `.pth` files

## Dataset

The project uses the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset, supplemented with synthetic images generated by the GAN to improve classification performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Flask
- Streamlit
- Roboflow API
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
